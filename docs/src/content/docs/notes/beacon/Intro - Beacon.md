ðŸ”¦ Beacon

Beacon is a protocol-first publishing toolâ€”part feed reader, part signal amplifier. Inspired by Dave Winerâ€™s call to reinvent the feed reader, Beacon reads from and writes to RSS, enabling individuals and communities to publish intentions, updates, and reflections without centralized platforms. Itâ€™s about broadcasting meaningfully, in a way that others can follow, remix, or subscribe to.
