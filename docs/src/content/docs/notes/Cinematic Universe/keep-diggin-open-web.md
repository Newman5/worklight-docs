## Remembering the Dream

In the late 1990s, I came across the work of Dave Winer through the *Anchorage Daily News*. It was a newspaper that used tools Dave had built, and even though I wasn’t a software engineer, I could follow his blog enough to grasp his vision: a web that was open, decentralized, and inherently social—without needing a central authority. That vision stuck with me.

Fast forward to now, and many of us are asking: *What happened to the dream of the open web?* Why does it feel like the social web we hoped for has calcified into centralized platforms, surveillance, and paywalls? Why is everything so... [enshittified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)?

Dave Winer never stopped working on the dream. He’s still building, writing, and calling for collaboration. His shortcut term for this is "still diggin’." He’s still publishing in RSS. He’s still pushing the envelope with tools like FeedLand, FeedBase, TextCasting, and Two-Way RSS. And he's still reminding us that simple, open protocols can do a lot—especially when people collaborate.

## What Is Worklight?

Worklight is my attempt to carry that same spirit forward. It’s not a product in the traditional sense. It’s a philosophy, a protocol-aware practice space, and a tool for people who want to coordinate and connect across space and time. Worklight emerged from personal needs—like doing synchronized Chi Gong sessions with my mom from opposite ends of the country—and evolved into a tool for distributed teams, educators, and communities to share presence and progress.

One of the core components of Worklight, called **Beacon**, started because Dave Winer literally asked for people to build a feed reader from scratch. [That post inspired me to try](http://scripting.com/2025/06/22/131333.html). And now, Worklight is growing into something more like a *switchboard*—something that can help people write anywhere, read anywhere, and coordinate without giving away their autonomy.

## Protocols Over Platforms

At the heart of this vision is a belief in **protocol networks**. This term comes from *Read Write Own* by Chris Dixon, but it maps closely to everything Dave Winer has been working on for decades: RSS, OPML, XML-RPC, and so on. Protocol networks create open spaces for collaboration. Unlike platform networks, they don’t rely on any single company to function.

> If a company disappears, does the network disappear with it? If yes, it’s a platform. If no, it’s a protocol.

Worklight is committed to being a participant in protocol networks. The simplest and most foundational protocol we support is **RSS**. Why RSS? Because it’s robust, elegant, and ubiquitous. It lets us publish everything from calendar events to journaling prompts to daily standups. And if someone reads it in a fancy new app or a crusty old RSS reader—it still works.

Even more important: if a reader can’t parse our full format, they should still get something readable. That’s the principle of **graceful degradation**—a kind of elegant fallback or backwards compatibility. The message still gets through, even if the reader’s tool is limited.

## Read/Write, Transparent, Together

Also, Worklight is built with another ethos in mind: **Sociocracy 3.0**. Not as a governance model per se, but as a philosophy: transparency, consent, and collaboration. Large groups of people can work together without centralized control—but it takes intention, structure, and tools that don't get in the way.

That’s why Worklight isn’t just for teams or devs. It’s for anyone who wants to:

* Coordinate across distance and time

* Create rhythms and rituals for connection

* Share signals in ways that are legible and replicable

## An Invitation to Collaborate

I hope Dave Winer hears this. I hope you do too.

Because if you're someone who still dreams about the web as it could be—open, social, user-owned—then Worklight might be something you’d want to use, or build, or remix.

This is my small contribution to that larger dream. A piece of the switchboard. A light in the window.

Let’s keep diggin’ together.
