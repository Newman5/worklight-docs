👋 Welcome to the Worklight Docs

This is the documentation site for the Worklight project and its many interwoven stories.
We call it the Worklight Cinematic Universe (WCU)—not because it’s fiction, but because each piece plays a role in a larger, evolving narrative:
One about the open web, distributed collaboration, and staying connected across time and space.
✨ What is Worklight?

At its core, Worklight is a protocol-aware coordination system.
It’s made for people who want to show up for each other—whether that’s through daily rituals, team check-ins, shared projects, or symbolic gestures of presence.

Worklight tools are designed to be lightweight, interoperable, and deeply human.
They draw inspiration from the open social web, from Dave Winer’s RSS ethos, from decentralized governance (Sociocracy 3.0), and from lived experience.
🔧 What You'll Find Here

This documentation is organized using the Diátaxis framework, to help you get what you need—no matter your starting point.

You’ll find:

```
Tutorials – Learn by doing

How-To Guides – Solve specific problems

Explanations – Understand the philosophy and design

Reference – Look up technical and structural details
```

Each part of the Worklight system—like Beacon, Lite, and the Dashboard—has its own set of docs.
And so do our living use cases, like Chi Gong with Mom, the ODIN Season of Collab, and the Votive Candle experiment.
🌱 Who is This For?

```
Developers who want to plug into open protocols

Community builders who care about soft accountability

Friends, families, and teams who want to feel connected, even when apart

You, if you still dream about the internet as a place of meaning and connection
```

🛠 Built With

```
Astro + Starlight

Tailwind CSS

Obsidian (via Markdown sync)

A deep respect for openness, clarity, and rhythm

🕯️ This project is a light in the window.
A signal. An invitation. A reminder that we can still build tools that work with us—not against us.
