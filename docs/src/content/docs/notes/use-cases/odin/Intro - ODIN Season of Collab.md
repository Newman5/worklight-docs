ðŸ”„ ODIN â€“ Season of Collab

A structured, seasonal collaboration sprint inside the Cardano community. ODIN teams use Worklight to run weekly standups, track tension and progress, and maintain transparency. The bot posts daily check-ins; the dashboard shows the rhythm. Itâ€™s Worklight as an open coordination surface for collective work.
