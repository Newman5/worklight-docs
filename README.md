# Worklight Documentation

> ✨ The Worklight project continues to expand and evolve—this is the place to document and explain it.  
> Built using the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to clearly separate tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and conceptual explanations.

## 📖 What is Worklight?

Worklight is an open, protocol-first coordination system for distributed teams and communities. Inspired by the open web ideals of Dave Winer and the principles of Sociocracy 3.0, Worklight is designed to support presence, collaboration, and personal agency in digital spaces.

This documentation site serves as the **Worklight Cinematic Universe (WCU)** hub, covering all major components:

- **Worklight Lite & Dashboard** – The coordination discord bot and web dashboard  
  → _[worklight-lite-dashboard](https://github.com/Newman5/worklight-lite-dashboard)_  
- **Worklight Beacon** – A community-powered feed reader and publisher  
  → _[worklight-beacon](https://github.com/Newman5/worklight-beacon)_  
- **Use cases** – Including the ODIN Season of Collaboration, Chi Gong sessions, and symbolic tools like votive candles

|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Tutorials     | Learn by doing                              |
| How-to Guides | Solve specific tasks                        |
| Reference     | Technical lookup and specs                  |
